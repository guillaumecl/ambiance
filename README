This is a simple tool audio tool that outputs some audio files
simultaneously at various positions in space.


The main way I use that is to feed it some ambiance sounds (forest,
waterstream, â€¦) to make myself feel somewhere else (hence the name).


This makes use of openal and libsndfile.

The supported formats are those that libsndfile supports.
